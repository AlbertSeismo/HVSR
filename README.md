# HVSR
The horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) of ambient noise provides information on the fundamental natural frequency of the local sediments when there is a large acoustic impedance contrast between sediments and underlying rocks.

This IRIS DMC Python script bundle provides tools to compute and plot horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) curves using MUSTANG PDF-PSD web service. The bundle contains 2 Python scripts: 

## Scripts in this bundle:
* ### computeStationChannelBaseline.py
is a Python script that uses MUSTANG's noise-pdf (http://service.iris.edu/mustang/) web service to compute channel-specific noise-baseline for a given station. The algorithm is based on McNamara et al. (2009).
