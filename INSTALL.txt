 horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:

 An IRIS DMC Python script bundle to compute and plot  horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) curves using MUSTANG PDF-PSD web service from IRIS.
 The bundle contains 2 Python scripts:

   - computeStationChannelBaseline.py is a Python script that uses MUSTANG's noise-pdf (http://service.iris.edu/mustang/) web service to 
     compute channel-specific noise-baseline for a given station (McNamara et al., 2009) the resulting baseline represents the long-term PSD PDF 
     characteristics of the station-channel pair in the form of median, lower and higher percentiles of the available PSDs for the station.

   - computeHVSR.py - is a Python script that uses IRIS DMC's MUSTANG noise-psd/pdf web services (http://service.iris.edu/mustang/) to
     compute horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) for a given station, with option to remove PSDs that fall outside the station noise baseline
     computed by computeStationChannelBaseline.py.

 PYTHON REQUIREMENTS:

    Basic installation:
       - this bundle was created and tested under Python 3.7.6;

       - additional required Python module(s): 
             . numpy        1.18.4
             . obspy         1.2.1
             . scipy         1.4.1
             . matplotlib    3.2.1

 BUNDLE INSTALLATION:
    - unpack the package
    - bin, lib and param directories and their contents are populated and required by the package. Other needed directories will be created by the script
      under the root directory of the bundle

 CONFIGURE THE PACKAGE:
    You should be able to run the package examples without any modifications. However:
    - if necessary, update the Python path on the first line of the bin/computeStationChannelBaseline.py and bin/computeHVSR.py scripts 
    - if desired, configure the package by updating param/getStationChannelBaseline_param.py and param/computeHVSR_param.py files

 PACKAGE TEST:
    - To test the package, run the scripts with no arguments and they will print the  corresponding USAGE messages.

           bin/getStationChannelBaseline.py
           bin/computeHVSR.py

    - Simply run any of the examples provided in the usage message.
